# Home Feature Server

This project is a personal server tailored to meet various personal needs.

The main idea is to create a api server+frontend with a Desktop like UI to manage household budgets, control homemade robots, and more.

This is a work in progress, and development is not a very straightforward process as it is a personal project.

## Getting started for development

### 1. Install dependencies

- Go `1.22.4` (used for VSCode plugin and generating/running tests locally)
- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/massivebugs/home-feature-server.git
cd home-feature-server
```

### 3. Create local Certificate Authority and certificate

- Download [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
- Create local CA and certificate

  ```bash
  mkcert -install && mkcert "\*.local" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 # Adjust if necessary
  ```

- Copy the certificate and key to the `devcerts` directory

### 4. Run containers

- `make start/stop/restart`: Start/stop/restart the DB, API server, and Node front end server/watcher.
- üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è To check if local api server is up and running, go to http://localhost:1323/api/v1/ping

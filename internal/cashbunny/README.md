## About Cashbunny

At it's core, it is a double-entry bookkeeping system, with interfaces designed for developers without sophisticated accounting knowledge.

I started developing this application with the intention of keeping my own financial status in check, as I was moving to a different country.

However, since I knew absolutely nothing about bookkeeping nor accounting, I had to refer to [these amazing resources](#references) about accounting, for developers.

## Features

### Basic multi-currency double-entry bookkeeping

### Intuitive budget planning interface

The planner is a tool which guides the user through recording their assets, revenues, liabilities and expenses via a zero-based budgeting method.

It aims to provide an easy-to-understand overview of the current financial situation, and provide forecasting & financial health insights and suggestions to improve on.

The planner requires 4 details regarding current financial status in order to provide insights:

    1. Current assets
        TODO
    2. Recurring revenues
        TODO
    3. Liabilities and payment schedule
        TODO
    4. Expenses and expense allocation
        TODO

Once all of the above information is set, the planner will return insights and suggestions on how they can improve their financial status by suggesting better liability payment schedule, adjusting expense allocation and so on.

### Notifications for pending payments etc.

# internal/repository

This directory contains implementations of repository interfaces.

At the moment, since this project uses code generated by sqlc (inside db/queries),
repositories are usually implemented by mapping structures generated by sqlc to internal models,
and also wrapping inconsistent/awkward types, relations etc.
